Tutorial for learning Python (very short)

The goal is to provide jupyter notebooks with a very short introduction to Python, with focus on: 
- basic pythons (how does it compares with Matlab?)
- numpy (how to use mathematical functions and arrays)
- matplotlib.pyplot (plot of a small data set)

This tutorial is part of the EON/ELSI Winter School 2018, for graduate and post graduate students.
